<p>Quiz is a website where you can ask open-ended questions to groups of users, and receive already verified and evaluated answers. 
    Each user is assigned a rating that encourages users to respond for your question and check other people's answers according to your template. 
    The author of a question can check the answers to his questions himself, or wait until several other users check each answer. 
    If the estimates for the answer are very different, the system warns about this and recommends the author to check the question himself and, 
    if necessary, penalize the user who poorly checked the answer.</p>
